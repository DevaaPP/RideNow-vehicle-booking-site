/**
 * Ride Payment Settlement Architecture:
 *
 * CUSTOMER (pays ₹300)
 *    │
 *    ├── 💵 Cash: collected by driver in hand
 *    ├── 💳 Wallet: deducted from customer wallet
 *    └── ⚡ Online: paid via Razorpay
 *
 * Split Payment Driver Reconciliation:
 * 1. If customer uses wallet + cash:
 *    - If walletAmountPaid > adminCommission:
 *      Platform keeps its commission, and surplus (walletAmountPaid - adminCommission)
 *      is credited to the Driver Wallet!
 *    - If walletAmountPaid < adminCommission:
 *      Wallet covers part of commission; the shortfall (adminCommission - walletAmountPaid)
 *      is deducted from driver's wallet balance, with any remainder added to platformDues.
 *    - If walletAmountPaid === adminCommission:
 *      Platform commission is fully covered by wallet payment; driver keeps full cash collected.
 * 2. If 100% Cash ride:
 *    - Full platform commission is debited from Driver Wallet / added to platformDues.
 * 3. If 100% Online / 100% Wallet / Split Online:
 *    - Driver net earnings (85%) credited to Driver Wallet.
